# Nameless Analytics | Manifesto

The Nameless Analytics Manifesto is a document that outlines the vision, mission, and values of Nameless Analytics. It is a living document that is subject to change as the project evolves.

## What really is Nameless Analytics
If you are like me, completely disillusioned with GA4, a compulsive tinkerer, a cloud-obsessed experimenter and a data lover searching for advanced, clever and actually functional solutions, then this is for us.

We are tired of proprietary platforms that promise "simplicity" but only deliver dependency and skyrocketing costs. 
We are tired of analytics platforms and their own closed systems that get in the way of you and your data.

For analysts, these are black boxes. 

For companies, they are strategic liabilities. 

We are tired of being treated as passive users. We want access to real raw data, the ability to define metrics that actually matter to the business, and the freedom to move our data without asking for permission.

Nameless Analytics isn't just for tinkerers. It's for organizations that understand that data is their most valuable competitive edge.

### Who it's for
It's not for everyone. It's not for those who prefer the comfort of a black box over the power of the truth. 

It's for:

* **Builders**, who want to create rather than just consume
* **Companies**, that treat data as a strategic asset, not a line item
* **Decision Makers**, who need auditable, transparent and functional numbers


If you're not ready to own your stack, feel free to keep letting others control your data.

</br>

### Our principles and values
* **The data belongs to whoever generates it.** Period. If you can't access the raw records, you don't own it.
* **Raw data is gold.** Metrics are just derived opinions. Always keep a copy of the truth.
* **Analytics is infrastructure, not an interface.** If you don't control the flow, you're just a tenant.
* **Dashboards are an output, not the truth.** Don't let pretty charts hide ugly realities.
* **Privacy is a consequence of architecture.** It’s about not collecting what you don’t need and owning what you do.
